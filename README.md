This project involves extensive data cleaning and transformation using Power Query and DAX to make the [dataset](https://github.com/abertpaat28/Healthcare-Analytics-at-MGH-with-Power-Query-and-Power-BI/blob/main/Hospital%2BPatient%2BRecords.zip) usable. Afterward, I loaded the cleaned data into Power BI to create the dashboard. 

You may download the [dashboard](https://github.com/abertpaat28/Healthcare-Analytics-at-MGH-with-Power-Query-and-Power-BI/blob/main/Healthcare%20Analytics%20at%20MGH%20with%20Power%20Query%20and%20Power%20BI.pbix) for a more in-depth exploration and interactive experience.
