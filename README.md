`I am happy to share to you that I have entered the world of healthcare!`

This simple project involved extensive data cleaning and transformation using Power Query and DAX to make the [dataset](https://github.com/abertpaat28/Healthcare-Analytics-at-MGH-with-Power-Query-and-Power-BI/blob/main/Hospital%2BPatient%2BRecords.zip) usable.  
Afterward, I loaded the cleaned data into Power BI to create the dashboard.
